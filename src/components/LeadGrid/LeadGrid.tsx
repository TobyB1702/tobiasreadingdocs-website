              Hello, my name is Toby. I love coding and building projects. I have a passion for learning new technologies and applying them to solve realâ€‘world problems. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends in the tech industry.
              <br /><br />
              I love AI and entered the industry straight after university by moving from a software engineer role to an AI engineer position in my first job.
              <br /><br />
              In my free time I enjoy training for CrossFit and Hyrox and have competed in several events. I'm also a big fan of A Song of Ice and Fire lore.
              <br /><br />
              Finally, it's my personal dream to move to and live in New York. I visited for the first time this February and fell in love with the city.
